3-4-3 Formation Analysis (Balance)
--------------------------------------------------
Recommended Lineup:
Keeper: Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Wojciech Szczesny
Defenders: Jules Koundé, Andreas Christensen, Inigo Martinez
Midfielders: Frenkie de Jong, Gavi, Pablo Torre
Forwards: Robert Lewandowski, Ansu Fati

Tactical Analysis:
- To achieve balance, it's crucial to utilize the midfielders' defensive capabilities and exploit the opponent's weaknesses with quick transitions.
- Incorporating Gavi and Pablo Torre in a supporting role will allow Frenkie de Jong to dominate possession and create scoring opportunities.
- Marc-Andre ter Stegen's exceptional shot-stopping abilities make him an ideal choice as the primary keeper, while Wojciech Szczesny provides a reliable backup option.

Key Strengths:
- The team's defensive solidity is bolstered by Jules Koundé and Andreas Christensen, who provide a strong anchor in defense.
- Robert Lewandowski's exceptional goal-scoring ability makes him an invaluable asset upfront.
- Frenkie de Jong's vision and passing range enable the team to control possession and create scoring opportunities.

Potential Risks:
- Lamine Yamal's limited goal-scoring record poses a risk if he is deployed as a primary striker.
- The midfield trio may struggle against opponents who can neutralize Frenkie de Jong's creative influence.
- Álex Balde's defensive limitations could be exposed by opponents who target him with precision crosses.
